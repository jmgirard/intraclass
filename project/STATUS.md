# Project status

- Milestone: **M25 — Bayesian multilevel (brms), nested Designs 2/3, balanced/complete, random** —
  **both slices done + committed on `m25-bayesian-nested` (`808b0cf`, `92ecd50`); pending PR CI +
  merge** (ADR-035; opened 2026-07-09 after the M24 retro). The direct
  continuation of the Bayesian arc — the **M8 analog of M24**: same brms engine + half-*t*(4,0,1) prior
  + `ci_method = "posterior"`, extended from the crossed (Design 1) five-component fit to the paper's
  two **nested-rater** designs (raters nested in clusters, Design 2, four components; raters nested in
  subjects, Design 3, three components / multilevel one-way). **Engine/interval parity, not new estimand
  work** (#6) — the shipped **M8 subject-level** coefficients (`M8-nested-multilevel.md` §3, ten Hove
  2022 Eqs. 8–11, Table 3 middle/right) read off posterior draws; no new estimand-spec, argument, or
  dependency. Scope = the M8 box: **subject level only** (cluster level undefined for nested raters),
  **Design 3 agreement-only**, balanced/complete, random. **Slice 1** Design 2
  (`fit_brms_nested_clusters()`; brms guard narrowed + nested dispatch) + O-Bayes-NML-agree. **Slice 2**
  Design 3 (`fit_brms_nested_subjects()`) + the coverage oracle (companion `data-raw/oracle-bayesian-nested.R`;
  committed `bayesian-nested-oracle.rds`) + O-Bayes-NML-reduction/-coverage/-converge. **Honest finding
  (#18):** the nested subject level is ~unbiased even at k=2 (rel-bias < .01, nominal coverage) — no
  boundary-prone cluster estimand is exposed; the M24-style "k=2 more biased low" pin didn't hold and
  was corrected to the run, not tuned. The M24 few-cluster
  MAP-low caveat is **largely not exposed** — nested designs report no cluster-level ICC, so σ²_c is a
  nuisance component, not an estimand. Both fits are simple mirrors of the shipped M8 glmmTMB shapes;
  `fit_brms_common()`/`brms_component_draws()`/`brms_convergence()` already generalize over any `spec`
  (M24 work). Maintainer chose **both nested designs in one milestone** (two slices) over Design-2-only.
- Prior milestone: **M24 — Bayesian multilevel (brms), Design 1 crossed, balanced/complete, random** —
  **shipped** (PR #29, ADR-034; squash-merged to `main` at `6566057`). The **highest-value Bayesian
  follow-on** — ten Hove's native turf: the paper's own multilevel IRR estimator (2020/2022) *is* the
  half-*t*-hyperprior Bayesian model M23 built, so M24 fits the paper's estimator on the paper's
  flagship design. A **thin vertical slice** standing to M23 as M5 stood to M1/M2 — same engine
  (`brms`) + interval method (`posterior`), extended to the five-component crossed fit under the
  half-*t*(4,0,1) SD prior (generalized verbatim). **Engine/interval parity, not new estimand work** —
  the shipped M5 subject/cluster coefficients read off posterior draws; no new estimand-spec, argument,
  or dependency; additive, non-breaking (#6). **Slice 1** subject-level (`fit_brms_multilevel()` +
  `fit_brms_common()` refactor; `brms_component_draws()`/`brms_convergence()` generalized to a component
  `spec`; the two-way-only guard narrowed to admit crossed Design 1 — nested/conflated/fixed/incomplete/
  one-way still abort loudly; brms multilevel dispatch). **Slice 2** cluster-level + the **O-Bayes-ML**
  coverage oracle (new `data-raw/oracle-bayesian-multilevel.R`, companion to the M23 script; committed
  `tests/testthat/fixtures/bayesian-ml-oracle.rds`). Findings reproduced **honestly** (#18):
  subject-level MAP ~unbiased + nominal coverage at k = 5 (rel-bias −1.5%, cover .94); cluster-level
  **few-cluster MAP-low caveat** at N_c = 20 (−16%/−25%, wide intervals still ~nominal). Oracles
  O-Bayes-ML-agree (live, MAP ≈ M5 glmmTMB/lme4 REML at the subject level) / -coverage (committed
  fixture) / -reduction (subject-level composes identically to two-way, no fit). Live Stan fits
  `skip_on_ci()`; CI covers via the committed fixture. Bayesian nested Designs 2/3 / fixed / one-way /
  incomplete / replicates / conflated stay deferred (later thin slices).
- Prior milestone: **M23 — Bayesian engine (brms) + `ci_method = "posterior"`, two-way random** —
  **shipped** (PR #28, ADR-033; the first Bayesian milestone, promoting the cross-cutting carryover
  deferred at M7/ADR-014). A **thin two-way-random slice** mirroring M5.5 (lme4) / M7 (lavaan) —
  engine + interval method, **not** new estimand work; additive, non-breaking (#6). Backend **brms**
  (rstan default, new `Suggests` behind `check_installed()`; `brm_args` passthrough forwards
  backend/chains/iter/cores per the ADR-033 amendment; rstanarm parked). Prior **half-*t*(4,0,1) on
  all random-effect SDs** (ten Hove et al. 2020 §3.3/§4.1). **MAP** point (mode of the ICC draws via a
  boundary-aware `posterior_mode()`, no new dep) + **percentile** credible interval; `"posterior"`
  forced-default & Bayesian-only. **Slice 1** engine end-to-end; **Slice 2** seeded MCMC +
  `brms_convergence()` (R-hat/bulk-ESS) + the **O-Bayes** coverage oracle
  (`data-raw/oracle-bayesian.R` reproduces ten Hove 2020's DGP through the shipped reduction and
  commits `tests/testthat/fixtures/bayesian-oracle.rds` (#4); findings reproduced with two reported
  divergences — convergence < 100% under fixed vs adaptive warmup; reflected-KDE σ_r MAP mildly
  low vs their `modeest`). Live Stan fit `skip_on_ci()` (no CI toolchain); CI covers the Bayesian
  path via the committed fixture. Bayesian fixed/one-way/multilevel/incomplete/replicates deferred.
- Prior milestone: **M22 — `d_study()` projection off a within-cell replicate fit** — **shipped**
  (PR #27, ADR-032; small standalone milestone after the M18–M21 arc). Promoted the one deferred
  `d_study()` corner (M17 §7 / M20): projecting the rater count `m` off a replicate fit, using the
  per-component `error_divisors` M17 already delivered (rater/interaction ÷ `m`, pure error ÷
  `m·n_o`), one curve per occasion setting (a new `occasions` column). **Slice 1** single-level
  two-way (fixed consistency via Spearman–Brown; fixed agreement refused) and **Slice 2**
  multilevel (crossed D1 + nested D2, subject across occasions, cluster single-occasion). Oracle
  O-RepDS (reduction at `m = k_eff` + cross-engine + Spearman–Brown + seeded coverage +
  monotone/[0,1]). No new estimand/spec/argument/dependency. Occasion projection and
  ragged-replicate projection stay deferred.
- Prior milestone: **M21 — SEM (lavaan) engine parity (bootstrap, fixed-rater, incomplete/FIML)** —
  **shipped** (PR #26, ADR-031; the **last milestone of the M18–M21 completeness arc**, ADR-027).
  Promoted the three M7 lavaan deferrals to lme4-style parity, engine parity not new estimand work:
  **Slice 1** `ci_method = "bootstrap"` for lavaan (M16 `simulate_refit` seam; `lavaan_simulate_refit`);
  **Slice 2** fixed-rater SEM — the Case-3A bias-corrected θ²_r (distinct from M7's raw; reduces to
  glmmTMB fixed AND random on balanced data, the M10 identity); **Slice 3** incomplete/FIML SEM
  (`missing = "fiml"`; attempt-then-degrade **resolved to ships** — consistency ≤8e-3, agreement
  ≤1.5e-2 vs glmmTMB, the raw-SEM small-sample bias not a FIML artifact; bootstrap gated on
  incomplete data). No new estimand/spec/argument/dependency. **The M18–M21 arc is complete — every
  🔵 not-yet gap in `COVERAGE.md` is closed.** M0–M21 shipped; package at v0.1.0.
- Active task: **M25 finish-task — installed-pkg verify + PR** — next. **Both slices are done and green
  locally** (live Stan present). Slice 1 (Design 2): `fit_brms_nested_clusters()`, guard narrowed,
  O-Bayes-NML-agree pinned live (committed at `808b0cf`). Slice 2 (Design 3):
  `fit_brms_nested_subjects()` (three-component multilevel one-way, agreement-only), Design-3 refusal
  guard removed + dispatched, consistency aborts; O-Bayes-NML-agree + reduction (Design 3 → flat
  one-way as σ²_c→0) pinned live; the **committed coverage fixture** `bayesian-nested-oracle.rds` (via
  the companion `data-raw/oracle-bayesian-nested.R`, n_rep 80) drives O-Bayes-NML-coverage/-converge on
  CI. **Honest finding (#18):** the nested subject level is ~unbiased even at k=2 (rel-bias < .01,
  nominal coverage) — no boundary-prone cluster estimand is exposed (nested = no cluster ICC); the
  a-priori "k=2 more biased low" pin imported from M24 was corrected to match the run, not tuned. Docs
  (@param/NEWS/COVERAGE/REFERENCES), `air`, and lint all clean. Remaining: the installed-package check
  (`NOT_CRAN=true` incl. live nested fits, `R CMD check --as-cran`) then open the PR. The DoD board is
  the M25 section of [`MILESTONES.md`](MILESTONES.md). Post-M25 work stays
  in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md): the
  other Bayesian follow-ons (fixed-rater, one-way, incomplete, replicates, conflated — each a later
  thin slice), categorical/ordinal GLMM, multilevel SEM, the Wave-3 averaged cluster-level `ICC(c,k)`
  incomplete divisor, and occasion-`d_study()`. The out-of-band **CRAN upload** (ADR-022) also remains.
- Last green CI: **PR #29 (M24) full matrix green incl. Windows and R-devel (all 9 jobs); squash-
  merged to `main` at `6566057`.** Local `R CMD check --as-cran` 0/0/1 (only the expected "New
  submission" NOTE); full suite `NOT_CRAN=true` 1041/0/0/0 incl. both live brms fits + merDeriv lme4
  multilevel. Prior: PR #28 (M23) at `a6b8467`.
- Blockers: —
- Updated: 2026-07-09 by main session (Opus) — **M24 retro done; M25 opened (ADR-035).** After the
  M24 retrospective (parity template held; cluster-level small-N_c caveat noted; clean process), the
  maintainer picked the Bayesian arc's next step: **nested Designs 2/3** (the M8 analog of M24), both
  designs in one milestone. This commit records ADR-035, adds the M25 board to MILESTONES (preamble +
  ADR list updated), and flips STATUS to M25-active. **No slice work has begun.** Next: M25 Slice 1
  (Bayesian Design 2). COVERAGE/REFERENCES nested-brms cells land with the slice work, not this commit.

## Where we are

**Support matrix** — [`COVERAGE.md`](COVERAGE.md) is the current-state stock-take of
what the `icc()` / `d_study()` argument space supports today, with a reason category
(not yet / research / blocked / by design) for every gap. Derived, not authoritative;
refresh it when a milestone ships.

**Shipped M0–M15** — see [`MILESTONES.md`](MILESTONES.md) for the record (single
source; not restated here, ADR-015). In short: the classic Shrout–Fleiss ICC family
is complete; glmmTMB, lme4, and lavaan are selectable engines through the M5.5 engine ×
design dispatch seam, and **lme4 now has full design parity with glmmTMB — two-way
random/fixed, one-way, and every multilevel design, on both balanced (M14) and
incomplete/ragged (M15) data** (degrading to glmmTMB only at the variance boundary);
the multilevel
estimator covers ten Hove et al. (2022) Designs
1–3 (crossed + both nested-rater); the crossed design handles **incomplete (ragged)**
data (subject level + cluster-level `ICC(c,1)`) with a declared-`design` disambiguation
and oracle-pinned identifiability guards (M9); and the crossed design also supports
**fixed raters** at the subject level, balanced (M10). The multilevel family is now
crossed × {complete, incomplete} × {random, fixed} at the subject level. Every fitted
`icc` object now has `autoplot()`/`plot()` methods — a coefficient forest plot and a
variance-component decomposition (M11). And `choose_icc()` turns the *Choosing an ICC*
decision tree into an interactive/programmatic helper that recommends a coefficient and
emits the exact `icc()` call — teaching/API, no new estimand (M12). And release polish
brought the pkgdown site, the M9–M12 showcase in `advanced.Rmd`, and a **CRAN-submittable
v0.1.0** (`--as-cran` 0/0/0), closing the ADR-017 arc (M13).

## Next action

**M25 (ADR-035) — Bayesian nested multilevel (Designs 2/3) — both slices done, pending PR CI + merge.**
`engine = "brms"` + `ci_method = "posterior"` now covers both nested designs at the subject level
(Design 2 four-component; Design 3 three-component / multilevel one-way, agreement-only) — the M8 analog
of M24, completing brms coverage of every multilevel design the frequentist engines fit at the subject
level. Committed on `m25-bayesian-nested` (`808b0cf` Slice 1, `92ecd50` Slice 2); full local gate run
by finish-task. **Next: open the PR to `main`** (`gh pr create`); on green CI + merge, reconcile the
`pending PR CI + merge` markers and compress the M25 board (ADR-015). The DoD
board is the M25 section of [`MILESTONES.md`](MILESTONES.md).
Post-M25 candidates in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md): the **remaining Bayesian follow-ons** (fixed-rater /
one-way / incomplete / replicates / conflated — each a later thin slice), **categorical/ordinal GLMM**
ratings, **multilevel SEM**, and the Wave-3 averaged cluster-level `ICC(c,k)` incomplete divisor. The
out-of-band **CRAN upload** (ADR-022) also remains. The M18–M21 completeness arc (ADR-027) is complete
(PR #23/#24/#25/#26); M22 (PR #27), M23 (PR #28), and M24 (PR #29) shipped after it.

**Arc — M18→M21, mixed-model completeness first, SEM last (ADR-027) — ALL SHIPPED:**

- **M18 — Multilevel completeness I (crossed, incomplete):** ✅ shipped (PR #23).
- **M19 — Multilevel completeness II (nested Designs 2/3):** ✅ shipped (PR #24) — incomplete
  nested + fixed-rater nested Design 2.
- **M20 — Within-cell replicate completeness:** ✅ shipped (PR #25) — fixed-rater · multilevel
  (crossed D1 + nested D2) · ragged single-occasion replicates. Occasion-averaged-ragged degraded
  to 🟣 research (no validated effective-`n_o` divisor). Extends M17 Slice 3.
- **M21 — SEM (lavaan) engine parity:** ✅ shipped (PR #26, ADR-031) — lavaan bootstrap, fixed-rater
  (Case-3A θ²_r), incomplete/FIML (ships, no degrade). The lavaan analog of the lme4 M5.5→M15 arc.

**Reclassified out of the arc (ADR-027):** multilevel SEM → cross-cutting "later" bucket
(research-flavored, sits beside Bayesian); lavaan + replicates → ROADMAP unscheduled (niche).

**Still to sequence (excluded from the M18–M21 arc, later):**

- **Wave 3 (research):** **M9 averaged cluster-level `ICC(c,k)` on incomplete data** (open
  per-cluster divisor — a focused simulation-oracle study, likely a Fable review). *Bounds
  M18 Slice 3 to the subject level.*
- **Cross-cutting, later:** the **Bayesian engine** two-way random path + `ci_method =
  "posterior"` **shipped as M23** (ADR-033, PR #28); its parity follow-ons (Bayesian
  fixed/one-way/**multilevel**/incomplete/replicates) remain later — multilevel is the
  highest-value (ten Hove's native turf). **categorical/ordinal GLMM ratings**; **multilevel
  SEM**; non-parametric/profile-likelihood CIs; boundary-robust lme4 singular-fit + merDeriv
  edge cases (glmmTMB covers these today).
- **Blocked, stays parked:** one-way / general ICC(1) via SEM — no faithful sourced route
  (ADR-014); not schedulable until a source appears.

**CRAN submission (out of band, ADR-022).** See below.

**Out-of-band thread (unchanged): CRAN submission (ADR-022).** The package is
submission-ready. A max-effort code review of the statistical core (2026-07-07)
verified the estimand/CI/engine math is correct and fixed 12 edge-guard / validation /
robustness findings (PR #20, merged `cae1c33`; regression tests in
`test-review-fixes.R`). Before uploading, run **win-builder** (R-devel + release) and
**R-hub**, then update the "will be run immediately before submission" line in
`cran-comments.md` with the results. `intraclass` does not (and cannot) submit for you.
*(Note: M14 — and now M15 — fold their changes into the existing `0.1.0` NEWS section
rather than bumping to a dev version, on the basis that 0.1.0 has not yet been uploaded
— revisit if 0.1.0 is frozen for submission.)*

The full carryover inventory (Bayesian + non-Bayesian, sourced vs. blocked) lives in the
parking lot in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md); the near-term ordering of the non-Bayesian
items is the sequencing plan above.

Workflow: milestone work ships on a `m<N>-<slug>` branch and merges via PR
(`milestone-branches-and-prs` memory); post-merge `project/` reconciles are a
direct commit to `main` (finish-task policy — no CI job reads `project/`).
