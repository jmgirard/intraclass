# M71: Re-verify the robustness and interval-methods extractions (7 notes)

- **Status:** in-progress   <!-- owner: transitioning skill · mirror-update; cairn/ROADMAP.md is the authority -->
- **Priority:** low   <!-- owner: plan · create/amend-via-gate; high | normal | low -->
- **Depends on:** —   <!-- owner: plan · create/amend-via-gate -->
- **Principles touched:** IP2   <!-- owner: plan · create/amend-via-gate -->
- **Branch/PR:** `m71-reverify-robustness-extractions`   <!-- owner: implement (branch) / review (PR URL) · create -->

## Goal
<!-- owner: plan · create; a wrong goal returns to plan, never edited in place -->

Extend M69's dated-verified extraction bar to M65's seven robustness and
interval-methods notes, closing the last of the source-note backlog.

## Scope
<!-- owner: plan · create/amend-via-gate -->

**In:** seven `cairn/references/<citekey>.md` notes (115 PDF pages) re-read
against their shelf PDFs: `bhandary2006`, `bobak2018`, `mehta2018`,
`saha2005`, `saha2012`, `xiao2009`, `xiao2013`. Anchors, quotations and
values corrected in place; each `Extraction:` line upgraded to a dated
verified status; `INDEX.md`'s M65 paragraph updated to match. Also in: the
two `bhandary2006` claims that `young1998.md` currently marks *inherited,
not verified* (M70's hand-off) — resolved in place once `bhandary2006` is
verified.

**Out:** the six M62/M67 notes → M70. `ORACLES.md` and `BIBLIOGRAPHY.md` →
M72. The `xiao2013` profile-likelihood GO/NO-GO assessment stays a
candidate row — this milestone verifies what the note claims, it does not
act on it. Any change to R code, tests, or oracle values.

## Acceptance criteria
<!-- owner: plan · create/amend-via-gate; review reads, never reinterprets -->

- [ ] Each of the seven notes has been read against its shelf PDF **to that
      source's final page** — `mehta2018` in particular, whose Appendices
      A–C sit at pp. 2750–2752 *after* the reference list and were once
      falsely recorded absent (LESSONS 2026-07-18/M65).
- [ ] Every quoted string in **every one of the seven notes** has been
      re-read against its source and confirmed verbatim or corrected. The
      sweep is mechanical and per-note, not driven by prior findings
      (LESSONS 2026-07-19/M67).
- [ ] Every page/table anchor resolves to the claimed page in the shelf PDF,
      with the pagination basis stated wherever the PDF is not the version of
      record.
- [ ] Every absence claim is settled by a rendered page image at high DPI,
      never the text layer alone, or else is stated as "not checked" and
      asserts nothing further.
- [ ] No note asserts anything time-relative that is false at merge.
- [ ] No package value changes: any correction that would move an oracle
      value, test fixture, or documented behavior is escalated as a review
      finding with its citation, not silently applied.
- [ ] `cairn_validate` passes and the seven notes no longer appear in the
      `references staleness` advisory — achieved by re-reading the sources,
      with no status line reworded to clear it (LESSONS 2026-07-18/M68).

## Coverage
<!-- owner: plan · create/amend-via-gate -->

- AC1 → T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7
- AC2 → T8
- AC3 → T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7
- AC4 → T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8
- AC5 → T9
- AC6 → T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T10
- AC7 → T10

## Tasks
<!-- owner: plan (create) / implement (check-off, minor edits) -->

- [ ] T1: `xiao2013` (25 pp) — the largest, and the one a live candidate row
      (profile-likelihood sibling) would rest on; verify the modified-PL
      claims and the documented naive-PL under-coverage especially.
- [ ] T2: `saha2012` (21 pp).
- [ ] T3: `mehta2018` (19 pp) — read past the reference list to the
      appendices at pp. 2750–2752; they hold the tables behind the paper's
      central safeguard claim.
- [ ] T4: `saha2005` (16 pp) — reconcile against `saha2012`, its sibling.
- [ ] T5: `bhandary2006` (14 pp) — INDEX.md places it in the M67
      equality-testing cluster by subject; confirm the cross-references that
      fence names actually hold. Then clear the two inherited-marker claims
      in `young1998.md` against this source.
- [ ] T6: `bobak2018` (11 pp).
- [ ] T7: `xiao2009` (9 pp).
- [ ] T8: mechanical quotation sweep — enumerate every quoted string in all
      seven notes and re-check each against its source; record the count
      swept per note as the evidence.
- [ ] T9: grep the seven notes for time-relative phrasing (`at the time of
      writing`, `not yet`, `today`, `must be checked`, `not retrieved`) plus
      the `Traces to` lead sentence, and re-resolve every hit.
- [ ] T10: update `INDEX.md`'s M65 paragraph and the backlog narrative; run
      `cairn_validate` and the r-package `verify` slot; confirm docs-only.

## Work log
<!-- owner: any skill · append-only; one line per entry; absolute dates. -->

- 2026-07-19: created by /milestone-plan (absorbs the M65 seven from the "remaining nine source extractions" candidate row, whose other two went to M70; plan gate: low priority — nothing in the package traces to these seven and five are outside the IP2 contract boundary).
- 2026-07-19: gated Scope amendment at the implement question gate — `young1998.md`'s two `bhandary2006` claims, marked inherited-not-verified by M70's T6 hand-off, are resolved in place under T5 (an eighth file, M70-owned). Also gated: notes re-read in the main session, not delegated; a correction falsifying the profile-likelihood candidate row's premise is fixed in the note and escalated as a review finding, never a silent ROADMAP rewrite.
